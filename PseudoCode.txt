Iterate through each row of the Raw CSV;
	Add in a Key index field
	Strip the Time-stamp from the "OrderDate" Field
	Iterate through each field in the row;
		Replace empty and "unknown" values with a stand-in for the NULL value (Would this be best accomplished with RegEx?)
	IF ModelCode field is NA value;
		Append explanation-code to end of row (~.insert function?? .append??)
		Write row to ExceptionReport file
		jump to next row
	IF Mfg field is "CAS";
		Append explanation-code to end of row (~.insert function?? .append??)
		Write row to ExceptionReport file
		jump to next row

	Compare Mfg field value to Mfg Key file, update value
	IF Mfg is not found in Key File;
		Append explanation-code to end of row (~.insert function?? .append??)
		Write row to ExceptionReport file
